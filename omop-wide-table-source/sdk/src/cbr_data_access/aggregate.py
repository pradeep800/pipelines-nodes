"""Aggregate OMOP cohort data into wide-format tables (one per dataset).

Runs **through** a :class:`~cbr_data_access.client.DataAccessClient` — i.e. through
the access-control proxy — not a direct database engine. Every table is referenced
by its plain name (``person``, ``measurement``, ``local_concept``, ...); the client
qualifies each to the request's ``req_<id>.<table>`` relation.

Because the proxy unions all of a request's cohorts into each relation (tagged with
a synthetic ``cohort_id`` column), every base table is pinned to ONE cohort with a
literal ``cohort_id = <id>`` WHERE filter. The joins deliberately do NOT re-match
``cohort_id``, and the small identity CTEs are MATERIALIZED: Postgres cannot see
base-table statistics through the proxy's rewrite, so instead of fixing the
estimates the query makes hash joins the only physically possible plan shape
(details on ``_LONG_SQL_TEMPLATE``).

Memory model: each cohort's long-format pull is spooled to temporary Parquet
part files on disk (one zstd-compressed part per fetch batch), and every
transform (dedupe, pivot) runs off that spool with polars' lazy streaming
engine. The cohort's long table is therefore never held in memory in
one piece — peak RAM is one dataset's deduped rows plus its wide result, not the
whole pull. This is what keeps large cohorts from swapping/OOMing mid-transform.

The result is ``{dataset_name: wide_dataframe}`` — one entry per
``local_concept.dataset`` — each shaped:

    Cohort | Barcode | Subject_ID | Gender | Visit | Assessment_Date |
    Age_at_Visit | <field_name_1> | <field_name_2> | ...

# scans only its own schema — and on cmp_participants the filter also keeps a
# barcode present in both cohorts from duplicating rows. Those filters make
# cohort_id JOIN conditions redundant, and the joins must NOT match on cohort_id
# (a synthetic constant with no column statistics — joining on it explodes
# cardinality estimates). The estimates stay wrong no matter how the joins are
# phrased (Postgres cannot see base-table statistics through the rewrite's UNION
# ALL subqueries), so person_base and visit_base are MATERIALIZED: a materialized
# CTE has no indexes, per-row nested-loop probes into it are impossible, and the
# planner must hash these small tables and stream the long rows through them once
# (per-row index-probe plans measured 38-48s vs the ~10-12s hash-join floor).
# Keep this query unsorted:
# final row/column ordering happens in Polars after pivoting, avoiding a large
# database ORDER BY over millions of long rows. No concept-id filtering here:
# the proxy admits only curated questionnaire concepts into req_<id>.* (both the

    The long-format pull runs one query per cohort, spooled to temporary
    Parquet part files in the system temp dir (/tmp). Each dataset is then
    deduped and pivoted straight off that spool with polars' streaming engine,
    so the long table is never held in memory whole — this keeps big cohorts
    from stalling in swap. Each cohort is merged into the final per-dataset
    frames before the next one runs.
    After all cohorts are merged, pivoted fields whose non-null values all
    parse as numbers are returned as ``Float64``; mixed/categorical and
    entirely-null fields remain ``String``. Identity columns are never inferred.
    It is serial by default because each cohort query is a large DB scan/stream;
    pass ``max_workers > 1`` to opt into concurrent cohort pulls when the
    backend, client RAM, and network path have headroom.

    Args:
        client: A :class:`~cbr_data_access.client.DataAccessClient` (resolves the
            request automatically; with several approved requests pin one via
            ``client.set_access(...)`` first).
        cohort: A single cohort to export, by id (``101``) or hardcoded name
            (``"SANSCOG"``, ``"TLSA"`` — see :data:`COHORT_NAMES`). The ``Cohort``
            column is dropped from the sheets, and only that cohort is queried.
            ``None`` (default) exports every granted cohort and prepends a
            ``Cohort`` column carrying the cohort names.
        gender_male / gender_female: Gender concept ids used to label ``Gender``.
        max_workers: Max cohorts fetched concurrently (capped at the cohort count).
            Defaults to 1 to avoid piling up heavy scans/streams.
        progress: If true, print aggregate phase timing. If callable, it receives
            each progress message. Strongly recommended for large cohorts — the
            fetch phase alone can run for minutes with no other output.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the request grants no cohorts, or the query returns no rows.
